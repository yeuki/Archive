# Changelog

All notable changes to Archive are documented here. Archive follows semantic versioning where practical and remains in pre-release development until version 1.0.0.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-13

### Baseline

- Established Archive's first formal versioned release.
- Preserved the current productivity, health, and workout experience as the reference baseline.
- Added immutable local and Google Drive APK archives, release checksums, and a repeatable release build script.
- Aligned the web package and Android application version with the repository `VERSION` file.

### Present functionality

- Daily habit, water, and sleep tracking with editable historical records.
- Modular dashboard panels, month-based value grids, charts, correlations, scores, and timelines.
- Workout schedules, routines, exercise library, workout logging, and detailed workout history.
- Approval-based Gemini coach with access to health, productivity, and workout context.
- Health Connect permissions and manual imports for steps, sleep, exercise, distance, calories, heart rate, HRV, and floors.
- Local-first persistence with JSON import and export.

### Known issues and unfinished work

- Health Connect synchronization is manual; background synchronization is not yet implemented.
- Health Connect history is limited to the recent access window unless extended history permission is added.
- The visual system is functional and consistent but has not yet received the planned premium design-system refinement.
- iOS packaging and Apple Health integration are future work.
